Bio-Mitomaster

THIS IS AN INITIAL UPLOAD THAT IS NOT QUITE FINISHED.  THIS CODE WORKS, BUT I AM STILL IMPORTING ALIGNMENT CODE FROM AN EARLIER VERSION.  IT SHOULD BE COMPLETED IN MAY 2010.

Bio::Mitomaster is a software framework that makes it easy to create programs that analyze mitochondrial genomic data of species for which there is an established reference sequence.  It differs from more general frameworks, such as Bio::Perl, by incorporating a systematic method to make use of the species meta-data (e.g. reference sequence, locus positions, etc.).  You can get more information from the included manual (perldoc Bio::Mitomaster::Manual).
